      <h3>Popular Questions</h3>
      <span class="badge badge-info pull-right">Q</span>
      <h4>Do I really need this?</h4>
      <p>If you develop a complex web applications with forms, links, and many
        pages, apis, and you want to
        <b>check all forms and links in a minutes</b>, you need to use testing framework.
        Codeception suites the best such tasks.
      </p>
      <span class="badge badge-info pull-right">Q</span>
      <h4>Why should I use this instead of PHPUnit?</h4>
      <p>Being the most popular unit testing framework PHPUnit has very limited
        features for functional testing with
        <b>Selenium</b>or other backends. Codeception is
        <b>PHPUnit on steroids</b>. Everything you need for testing is built-in and
        works just out of the box. No more pain in configuring data cleanup, paths,
        Selenium connections, and fixtures.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <span class="badge badge-info pull-right">Q</span>

      <h4>No need for this. It looks just like Behat</h4>
      <p>Hold on! Even it uses the same style in test description and Mink as a
        driver, Codeception is completely different. As you know,
        <b>Behat is not a testing framework</b>, but Codeception is. Codeception
        tests are written in PHP they are written much faster, especially if you
        use IDE . You can use
        <b>variables and operators in your tests</b>. You can use
        <b>CSS and XPath</b>selectors in your tests. This features allows you to
        build a solid test automation platform for testing your web application.
        Even though Codeception test are very readable for your developers, managers,
        and QA team.
      </p>
      <h4>We are planning to use Selenium. Why Codeception?</h4>
      <p>Codeception works great with Selenium. But Codeception provides much more
        flexible and powerful language then Selenium IDE does. And well, you don't
        need to learn Java or Python for complex Selenium tests, PHP is ok. And
        the main reason is: Selenium tests are tightly bound to XPath locators.
        If you ever change anything in layout tests will fall. Codeception locators
        are more stable. You can use names, labels, button names and CSS to match
        elements on page. It's much easier to support the Codeception test then
        Selenium's one.
      </p>
      <h4>Why do all tests starts with 'Guy'?</h4>
      <p>I'm not a sexist in any form, but we call the test worker a Guy. Think
          of it as a imaginable person that describers his actions in PHP DSL. I
          am new guy, he says. I want to test your application, he says. I click
          "Log In", fill fields, and I see "Hello" in page, he says. In our team
          we just thought it is more natural to write tests from a person's perspective,
          then just commands.

        <span class="badge pull-right">PhpBrowser</span>
        <p class="muted">This test can be executed inside Mozilla Firefox using Selenium Webdriver,
          or any browser. Nevertheless, you can execute this test without any browser
          but with PHP browser emulator. It's much faster and don't require Selenium
          and Frame Buffer installed. The downsides are: you can't test Javascript
          in it.</p>

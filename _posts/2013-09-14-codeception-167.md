This release is minor, yet fixes lots of bugs you might have encountered. If you didn't encounter them, well, then, lucky you. Still it's a good idea to upgrade. Maybe you will encounter some bugs after that :)

Ok, let's turn off the irony mode, and post a regular list of changes.

* **fix to 80 port issue**, if you had problems connecting to server via PhpBrowser, then this must be it. Thanks to **@tiger-seo**.
* fix in REST module when using `application/json` header and passing parameters.
* **seeJsonResponseContains** of REST can now search on all nesting levels.
* fix to Sequence module.
* Step class code improved by **guilhermeFranco**
* Using suite with defined namespace was improved by **@Borales**.
* Generators fixes by **@piccagliani** and **davert**.

I'm PHP and ROR developer from Kiev, Ukraine. I like web development, tourism, kayaking, etc. But most of time I spend developing products. I hope Codeception is one of them.

I'm a member of a [Codegyre](http://codegyre.com/) developers team. If you need professional web developers for startup **we are ready for hire**!
We are ready for remote work on long term contracts. As well we can provide services and consulting for Codeception.
